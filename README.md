## Quiz Game

This project is a React-based web application of a quiz game. 

The player has 60 seconds to answer as many general questions as possible. 

There are 2 types of questions: True/False and multiple choice. 

Each correct answer will give the player points based on the question's difficulty: easy- 1 point, medium- 2 points, hard- 3 points. If the player answered correctly in a row he will get bonus points: number of correct answers in a row multiply by the difficulty of the question.

Each round the player has 3 lifelines: 1 Ask the Audience and 2 50:50.
The Ask the Audience lifeline gives the player the "crowd's answer suggestion" which is 70% of the time the correct answer.
The 50:50 lifeline eliminates 2 wrong answers. The player can't use it twice on the same question nor on True/False questions (because it will reveal the correct answer...).
